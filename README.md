# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The school board has found evidence of academic dishonesty in the reading and math scores of Thomas High School students, especifically those in the 9th grade. The purpose of this analyisis is to a new school distric analyisis of the scores replacing those scores afected with NAN, and see how those replacements affect the overal analysis of the school. 
      
## Results 

To get the new results we first had to replace all the scores of the 9th graders with NaN. To do this we used the loc() function in pandas. See link below.

After doing the analysis we can the that were 471 scores affected by this measure, and now we can proceed to to the school district analyisis.
